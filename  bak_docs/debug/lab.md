## Lab 4.1 - Break Before User Code Starts

The labs-1 folder contains an `app.js` file. Start `app.js` with Node in Inspect Mode, but with the application immediately paused on the first line of executable code.
If this task is performed correctly, the program should be paused on line 5. This can be verified by connecting Chrome Devtools to the Inspector via the "chrome://inspect" URI, finding the process under "Remote Targets", clicking "inspect" and ensuring the "Sources" tab is selected.

## Lab 4.2 - Setting a Breakpoint Using a Code Keyword

The labs-2 folder has an `app.js` file, edit the file so that when started in Inspect mode it will pause in the first line of the f function.
To verify, start the app.js file in Inspect mode (without breaking before user code starts). Connect Chrome Devtools, and ensure the "Sources" tab is selected. All being well, the application should be paused at line 2.
