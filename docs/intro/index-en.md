# 01.INTRODUCTION

## Course Introduction

Welcome to Node.js Application Development (LFW211)!

This course provides core skills for effectively harnessing a broad range of Node.js capabilities at depth, equipping the student with rigorous foundational skills and knowledge that will translate to building any kind of Node.js application or library. In the case of HTTP-based Node.js applications (or Node.js services) this content is an essential counterpart to Node.js Services Development (LFW212) course. While by design the training content covers everything but HTTP and web frameworks, the crucial fundamentals presented prepares you to work with web applications along with all types of Node.js applications. This includes command line tools, real-time applications, network applications, desktop applications, build tools and more.

By taking this course, you will be fully prepared for the OpenJS Node.js Application Developer Certification and acquire pragmatic knowledge and core skills that accelerate both Node.js productivity and career growth.

## Course Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, you should be able to:

- Understand foundational essentials for Node.js and JavaScript development.
- Become skillful with Node.js debugging practices and tools.
- Efficiently interact at a high level with I/O, binary data and system metadata.
- Attain proficiency in creating and consuming ecosystem/innersource libraries.
- Achieve comprehensive familiarity with a broad range of Node.js capabilities.
